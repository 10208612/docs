The J.U.P is Jupiterâ€™s vision for a multi-pronged community which works in tandem to move both Jupiter and the crypto space forward. It is made up of users, the team, the DAO, Catdets and Working Groups.

## What are Catdets?

Catdets are the most active members of the Jupiter community who are consistently helpful and dedicated to uplifting others in the J.U.P.

You can recognize them by their red colored role in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jup), but the role is not exclusively limited to Discord. You can also become a Catdet by contributing and helping others in platforms such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jupiterexchange/), [Twitter](https://x.com/jup_dao), or through [real life interactions like activations](https://x.com/0xSoju/status/1859145404585308503).
