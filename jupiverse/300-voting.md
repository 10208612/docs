Voting is a fundamental activity for the members of the Jupiverse, this allows any community member with staked JUP to put in a say on proposals and steer the DAO towards the direction of the decision of the community.

Before voting, you will need to buy JUP and stake it at https://vote.jup.ag/.

## How do I stake my JUP?

1. Visit the voting site, and connect your wallet.
2. Choose the amount to stake and click on the button **“Stake”**.
3. Your specified amount of JUP tokens will sent to an escrow account.

:::note No Mimum To Vote
There is no minimum JUP needed to be eligible to participate in the voting process. You can vote even if you have staked 1 JUP.
:::

:::note Unstaking Period
Do note that the unstaking process will require 30 days to be withdrawable for both full and partial unstake.

## How do I unstake my JUP?

1. Navigate to the **"Unstake"** tab of the stake terminal.
2. Choose the amount to unstake (max for full unstake) and click on the button **“Unstake”**.
3. Your JUP tokens will fully unlock after 30 days, you can still vote.

    - For full unstake, your voting power will decrease linearly until the 30 day mark.
    - For partial unstake, you lose your voting power immediately for the amount of partial unstaking.

## How do I vote on a proposal?

1. During a live vote, scroll to the next section of the page where the **"Proposals"** are listed
2. Click on the active measure.
3. Read. Read. Read. Understand the intention of the proposal, the proposed options and their outcomes/consequences.
4. Then, cast your vote.

:::note Voting Power
1 staked JUP = 1 voting power, the more you stake, the more voting power you have.
:::

:::note Quorum
A minimum number of votes needed for each proposal to have a valid result. This is to ensure there is enough participation and to prevent manipulation by a small group of people holding large amounts of tokens.

Quorum: 50%, Total Staked Tokens: 100, Votes needed to be valid is at 50.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I change my vote?

Yes, only before the voting period ends. Repeat the steps to vote by selecting another option.

#### Does what I vote for affect my voting rewards (ASR)?

No it does not. The only important thing is that you participate.

#### My unstaked JUP after 30 days cannot be claimed.

Reclaiming your JUP requires an open token account for JUP in your wallet. If you’ve used a wallet cleanup service, it likely closed any empty token accounts, but you can easily reopen them by buying a tiny amount of JUP, and then you will be able to claim.

#### My voting power is lesser than my staked JUP.

If you are unstaking, your voting power will be decreased.

- For full unstake, your voting power will decrease linearly across the 30 days.
- For partial unstake, you lose your voitng power immediately for the amount of partial unstaking.

When you vote while you are unstaking, the final voting power you can utilize is equal to the voting power you will have when the voting period of the proposal ends.

#### How do I never miss a vote?

There are a few ways to stay informed. One is to always keep an eye on the Discord Announcements channel. Most votes and the leadup to them last at least 7-10 days, and votes themselves last 3-4 days. Often they are mentioned during the livestream events such as the weekly Planetary Call.

However, you can also keep watch on the [DAO Twitter](https://x.com/jup_dao) which not only posts vote calendars, but also reminders during a vote.

Lastly, a 3rd option which is to opt into email reminders via the vote page, and click notify me to be sent an email during a vote.
