DAO is an acronym for **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**. Many DAO’s have been attempted over the years, yet few have stood the test of time. Luckily our thinking around DAOs is that “we practicalize them, not romanticize them” and with persistence, the stand tall and proud.

## What is the Jupiter DAO?

It is a community-run system of governance which seeks to actively push forward both Jupiter and Solana as a whole. The DAO conducts votes using the JUP governance token. For the first year, the DAO takes the first step to form up the main talent pool for Working Groups, fund Working Group Budgets, distribute grants, and more. Over time the DAO will further extend its scope and responsibilities as it becomes more decentralized.

## How do I vote in the DAO?

Join the community discussions on Discord, Twitter and the Research Forum to educate yourself about any upcoming votes. When a proposal goes live, simply make sure your JUP is staked and cast your vote based on the information you have gathered. The more JUP you stake, the higher your voting power when you vote.
