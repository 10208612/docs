Working Groups are task forces of independent operators who guide critical work in areas like growing the Jupiter community, enhancing the J.U.P ecosystem, and creating processes for the DAO.

## Formation of Working Group

Forming a Working Group is a multi-step system that starts at doing work for the DAO, then receiving a grant, becoming a trial, and finally becoming a full fledged WG. [You can read more about the Microgrants Initiative here](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-microgrants-initiative/21583).

#### I want to start but I don’t know how.

There are several ways to get involved in the Jupiter DAO. Some good ways to just get started are:

1. **Be Proactive and Helpful:** Work your way up to the Catdet role by actively engaging with the community. Many Catdets are at the forefront of initiatives and are deeply attuned to the happenings within the Jupiverse.

2. **Volunteer for Initiatives:** Contribute to ongoing projects, whether by joining an existing Working Group or offering general help to the community, such as answering questions or supporting others on platforms like Reddit.

3. **Pursue Bounty Opportunities:** Keep an eye out for bounties or task-based opportunities that allow you to contribute in meaningful ways. These are often a great starting point to showcase your craft and communication.

4. **Create Impactful Content:** Produce helpful materials like videos, threads, or infographics, and share them across relevant platforms. Quality content not only educates but also enhances the visibility of Jupiter and its initiatives.

5. **Explore DAO Contribution Ideas:** If you’re unsure where to start, [refer to thought-provoking resources like this essay](https://x.com/SlorgoftheSlugs/status/1836925337881493513) for inspiration on what might be valuable to the DAO. Use these insights to identify areas where your skills can make a difference.

6. **Engage and Absorb Information:** Actively participate in discussions on Reddit, the Jupresearch forum, or Discord. By staying informed and interacting with the community, you may discover new opportunities or innovative ideas to pursue over time.

Being attentive, supportive and consistent goes a long way.

#### I’ve been working on something and want to level it up with a grant.

Once you’ve begun doing work for the DAO, feel free to apply on the [Superteam grant portal](https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/jupiter-dao-grants)

Additionally, you can reach out to a member of the Grant’s council, which is composed of Slorg, Morten, Cas, Julian or Kemosabe in order to get a mentorship session and guidance.

[If you’d like an overview, you may consult this Jupresearch post](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-dao-grants/22681)

#### I’m active, but I’m not sure if I'm cut out. What can I look into in order to make that determination?

A good place to start would be the [JUP & JUICE casestudy](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/jup-juice-casestudy/22138), detailing how they ascended through the grant stage to reach a Trial Working Group before any system was in place.

Additionally you can always reach out to a current Working Group or a Grant Recipient to get any insights on their experience and how it may translate over to you.
