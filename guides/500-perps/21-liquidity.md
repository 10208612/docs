When a user adds liquidity to the JLP pool, they increase the amount of TVL (Total Value Locked) which increases the liquidity available for perps trading. The pool is currently a collection of the following tokens: **SOL, ETH and WBTC, USDC, USDT, **.

## Adding Liquidity

Any Liquidity providers (LPs) can acquire JLP by swapping for it on Jupiter Swap. Jupiter Swap will find the best price to acquire JLP for you, automatically. This can either be purchasing it off the open market, or swapping it for a desired asset and depositing that into JLP directly. Use Jupiter Swap for a frictionless experience of getting JLP. While JLP is still being minted, your assets may be deposited into the relevant token pool increasing the current weightage. At the point of depositing assets into the JLP pool, the protocol will re-price the TVL in the USD value.

## Removing Liquidity

JLP can also be sold via Jupiter Swap. Simply swap JLP for your desired asset. The JLP token could either be transferred to another trader or may be redeemed by the JLP pool, burning the JLP token, and releasing some of the currency contained in the pool.
