Jupiter is fully supported within the [Solana.Unity-SDK](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-Core/tree/master/src/Solana.Unity.Dex). The core library is independent of Unity and can be incorporated into Unreal Engine using the UnrealCLR library or in a C# backend.

Using the Solana.Unity-SDK, game developers can effortlessly incorporate Jupiter swaps into their games and achieve cross-platform compatibility without the need to modify a single line of code.

Within the SDK, the Jupiter Swap API can also be used as a [payment method](./5-payments-through-swap.md), enabling you to utilize Jupiter + SolanaPay for facilitating user payments with any SPL token, allowing pricing in USDC or other tokens.
