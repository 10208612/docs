### Original Copy

The Jupiter swap backend systems have been completely re-engineered for the Metropolis update. This upgrade has significantly improved token discovery, slippage management, token search functionality, and safety measures.

### Instant Routing for New Tokens
New tokens from Raydium, Meteora, and Orca are immediately added to Jupiter Routing. This means that newly launched tokens can be utilized across the entire Jupiter suite instantly! This includes features like DCA, Limit Orders, and Value Averaging, or simply swapping at the best prices available.

### Intelligent Token Search
With the rapid growth of tokens on Solana, finding the correct token can be challenging. The token list search feature has been vastly improved, taking into account near real-time information such as liquidity, volume, community verification, and potential dubious tokens. Imposter tokens and duplicates are automatically filtered out, making the search much faster and more accurate.

### Master Token List Standard
This upgrade enhances the token verification process. Instead of relying on a single strict list as in V2, Metropolis incorporates a range of lists across the entire ecosystem. Currently, different token lists are aggregated into an Ecosystem Master List, with new labels such as "LST," "Pump," "Clone," and a unified standard for partners to contribute.

Jupiter Swap V3 brings us much closer to fulfilling the Jup Promise: Best Price, Best Token Selection, Best UX!
